1. x->f1(),if we know x is a pointer .then x is a pointer of type.

2. Rct r; int area = r.setLength(3).setBreadth(4).getArea();
what should be return type of setLength and setBreadth...

3. 
int *ptr =new int, here which one is on heap.
a. new int
b. ptr.
c. both new int and  ptr.

4. int &a=7;
it wont compile 
it will compile.

5. 
const functions is applicable to
a. non static functions of the class
b. static functions of the class.
c. global functions of the class.


6. mutable word is used in context of
1. variables
2. functions
3. lamdas
4. classes.

7. 
A obj; obj =3; to make this compile
 we need to 
 a) overload the assingment operator in class A
 b) overload the cast operator
 c) overload cast operator.
 d) none of the above.
 correct answer is a.
 
 8. 
runtime polymorphism means we need
a) virtual function call.
b) base class pointer.
c) both a and b.
correct answer is c.

9. 
Lambda in c++ helps in
a) defining a function
b) passing the function as a variable.
c) both a and b.


10. explicit word is used with
1. class
2. any member function
3. only with constructor.

11.
class A
{

public:
	void f1() { f2(); }
	virtual void f2()  { std::cout << 2; >
};
if f1 function is called, what it will print.


12.
class A
{

public:
	int i;

	A():i(0)  { A(3);  }
	A(int x):i(x)  {   }
	int geti() const { return i;}
}
int main()
{
	A obj;
	std::cout << obj1.geti();
